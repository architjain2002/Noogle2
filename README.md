# **Noogle**

## Welcome to Noogle!


<i>Say No to Google.</i>


## **Problem we are trying to solve:**
Statistically an average developer spends around 35-50% of his time in debugging the code. The process includes repeatedly switching to a browser for searching warnings and errors and referring to documentations. Having multiple windows/tabs open on your screen can be very annoying and hampers the productivity of the developer.


## **Features**

<p> Noogle, as mentioned is a VS Code extension which helps our fellow developers to quickly access suggestion to the problems encountered. </p>


<i> This extension provides us instant and appropriate hints to debug the errors and bugs encountered without switching to the browser. </i>


<p> Moreover our extension automates and links to the documentation of the framework or library we are working with by detecting our imports on VS Code itself for easy access.</p>


<i> With all these rich features and user friendly design, developers will find it more convenient to look up for a fix and everything will be encapsulated in your favourite IDE YOUR VS CODE! </i>

<b> Whenver you have an error in your code just use   `` alt + n ``
